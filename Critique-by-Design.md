# Overview
In this assignment,  I'll pick a visualization from the Makeover Monday website, analyze it, sketch out a solution, put it to the test, and finally, revamp the visualization incorporating both the feedback I get and my own intuition.

# Step one: Picking a data visualization from MakeoverMonday 
I decided to analyze the  visualization titled "Drinking and Date." You can find it here: https://data.world/makeovermonday/2023w34. The reason for my choice lies in the fascinating gender-specific preferences it reveals. The unexpected twist? Women surprisingly lean towards martinis more than men, defying my initial assumption about the drink's strength influencing preferences.

# Step two: Critiquing the data visualization
Now that , i have picked my visualization, let's delve into the Critique.

One thing I love about this graph is the title "Most Popular Drink." As I delved into the graph, it became clear that it was comparing women versus men within each drink category. I appreciate the classification of men's drinks from most liked to least liked, easily depicted on the graph. Nevertheless, the use of the same color for both genders introduced an element of confusion. I found myself unsure whether the unique colors represented the drinks or the genders. Additionally, bolding the numbers in front of each bar proved distracting and took away from the overall visualization. 

To improve the graph,  I suggest replacing the numbers in front of each bar with an x-axis labeled "Drink Preferences (%)," displaying the percentages. This modification would contribute to a less cluttered appearance and enhance the overall clarity of the chart. To further improve visual clarity, I recommend opting for a side-by-side bar chart for each drink category, presenting separate charts for women and men. This approach would offer a distinct portrayal of the differences in drink preferences. Furthermore, assigning unique colors for men and women, rather than using the same color for both, would eliminate potential confusion.

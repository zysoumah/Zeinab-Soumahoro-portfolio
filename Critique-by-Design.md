# Overview
In this assignment,  I'll pick a visualization from the Makeover Monday website, analyze it, sketch out a solution, put it to the test, and finally, revamp the visualization incorporating both the feedback I get and my own intuition.

# Step one: Picking a data visualization from MakeoverMonday 
I decided to analyze the  visualization titled "Drinking and Date." You can find it here: https://data.world/makeovermonday/2023w34. The reason for my choice lies in the fascinating gender-specific preferences it reveals. The unexpected twist? Women surprisingly lean towards martinis more than men, defying my initial assumption about the drink's strength influencing preferences.

# Step two: Critiquing the data visualization
Now that , i have picked my visualization, let's delve into the Critique. 

One thing I love about this graph is the title "Most Popular Drink." As I delved into the graph, it became clear that it was comparing women versus men within each drink category. I appreciate the classification of men's drinks from most liked to least liked, easily depicted on the graph. Nevertheless, the use of the same color for both genders introduced an element of confusion. I found myself unsure whether the unique colors represented the drinks or the genders. Additionally, bolding the numbers in front of each bar proved distracting and took away from the overall visualization. 

To improve the graph,  I suggest replacing the numbers in front of each bar with an x-axis labeled "Drink Preferences (%)," displaying the percentages. This modification would contribute to a less cluttered appearance and enhance the overall clarity of the chart. To further improve visual clarity, I recommend opting for a side-by-side bar chart for each drink category, presenting separate charts for women and men. This approach would offer a distinct portrayal of the differences in drink preferences. Furthermore, assigning unique colors for men and women, rather than using the same color for both, would eliminate potential confusion.

# Step three: Sketching out a solution
Now that I have critiqued the visualization, I am going to sketchout the solution

To redisign the visualization, I opted for a side-by-side chart, placing the drink names at the top and utilizing the percentage of drink preferences on the y-axis. I introduced separation lines, I chose The side-by-side chart with clear separation lines and distinct columns because it help to compare preferences across different drinks. Within each column, I represented both women and men with individual bars. For instance, in the beer column, you can easily observe the percentage of men and women who favor beer, providing a clear comparison. Additionally, a third insight emerges, indicating that men tend to prefer beer more than women. To enhance clarity, I assigned different colors for men and women—opting for green for men and orange for women to ensure a non-discriminatory representation.

# Step 4: Testing the solution
To Test the solution, I sought input from two of my friends, whose perspectives I will include below.

##### Feeback 1 from a 28 old female:
"When I first looked at your graph, I initially thought you were comparing the monthly drink consumption per drink category between women and men. This was a bit misleading, and I had to examine the graph closely to realize it wasn't what I initially thought.
Furthermore, as I tried to interpret the visualization, I assumed you were comparing alcoholic drinks versus non-alcoholic drinks since it transitioned from beer to coffee to margarita, etc. I was attempting to discern a logical pattern.
Regarding the color choices, perhaps using blue for men and pink for women could make the comparison more intuitive.
Considering the intended audience—restaurants, bars, airport lounges, grocery stores, etc.—I suggest focusing on one group at a time. It might be beneficial to create separate plots for men and women, highlighting their preferred drinks to make the data clearer."

##### Feeback 2 from a 28 old male
"I noticed some potential flaws for the chart you presented. I thought the chart title subtly implied your intention to visualize preferences for favorite drinks among both men and women. While I agree that the side chart effectively portrayed these preferences, I believe we could delve deeper.
I suggest creating a more detailed population pyramid chart, segregating men on one side and women on the other. With this approach, the y-axis would display drink names, while the x-axis would present percentages. Additionally, sorting men's drink preferences in descending order could add another layer of insight, offering viewers a comprehensive perspective on the data.I hope this feedback inspires you to consider a more intricate and informative approach to representing drink preferences visually.”

# Step 5: Building The Solution
After analyzing my friends' feedback, I identified several similarities. Both friends noted their initial confusion about the chart's message and recommended segregating the data by gender for improved clarity. Additionally, they both suggested using distinct colors for men and women to facilitate comparison and proposed focusing on one gender at a time to simplify the presentation for the intended audience.
I appreciate both approaches suggested by my friends. Depending on the message I aim to convey — identifying the preferred drinks for men and women — I believe the diverging bar chart recommended by one friend would be effective. It allows the audience to easily compare the preferences of both genders simultaneously. However, I also value the insights provided by my initial sketch, especially for those interested in understanding the preferences within each category for both men and women.
Considering these factors, I have decided to create two visualizations for the redesign. The first one will be the diverging bar chart as per my friend's recommendation, emphasizing the overall gender preferences. The second one will be based on my initial solution, providing detailed insights into the preferences within each category for both men and women.

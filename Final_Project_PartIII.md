## The audience
Based on the interviews I conducted and my own judgment, I've identified several target audiences for my project. Firstly, individuals working in the tech industry are a primary audience since this topic directly concerns them. In addition, Many aspire to work in tech, lured by promises of high salaries and benefits, but often overlook the potential challenges and strains of the profession. Consulting is notorious for its heavy workload and long hours, but I discovered similar pressures exist in the tech sector. 
Additionally, I've chosen to focus on Human Resources professionals within tech companies. This decision stems from my observation that many employees lack access to mental health resources within their organizations, and the topic is often avoided altogether. By targeting HR professionals, I aim to raise awareness about the importance of addressing mental health issues in the tech workforce.
In line with my audience's needs, I plan to provide resources that benefit both employers and employees in the tech industry. For instance, employers can access training materials on mental health awareness to implement within their companies. Meanwhile, tech workers can find support and counseling through the resources listed on my website

## Final design decisions
###  Identified Changes from part 2 to part II
#### Improvements Plan:
1.	Introduce a Relatable Persona: You should consider incorporating a character into the overview to enhance engagement.
2.	Adjust Legend Title Color: You should modify the color of the legend title to improve visibility and clarity.
3.	Enhance Chart Titles: You should augment chart titles by appending sentences that succinctly describe the main insights.
4.	Utilize Call-Out Statistics: You should employ call-out statistics to emphasize key figures, such as the percentage of UK and US tech workers.
5.	Include Tangible Resources: You should integrate practical resources to provide additional support and guidance for the audience

#### Final Decisions Changes
Based on TA , Professor and The TA feedback, Here are the changes I am made to make on my final story
1.	I revised my overview by shifting from using quotes to crafting a persona based on the story of my friend, following Professor Chris's recommendation.
2.	In my visualization, I enhanced visibility by changing the color of the title and included statistics directly on the chart. This was particularly relevant for the graph discussing employees' willingness to address mental health concerns with their employer.
3.	I improved the descriptive nature of my title, ensuring that my audience can readily comprehend the subject matter of the charts.
4.	Utilizing called-out statistics in my shorthand story facilitated easy visibility for my audience, allowing them to grasp key data effortlessly.
5.	To personalize my call to action, I included links to resources tailored for individuals in the tech industry who may be struggling with mental health issues. This addition aims to assist those who may not be familiar with available support resources.

#### Design Decision 
The choices of the pictures for my story were a challenge for me . Since mental health is a sensitive topic, I didnâ€™t want to use images that could be triggering . So I spent more 30 minutes to find the perfect images . For the overview part, I used the persona I create based off my friend story and then I added a picture to make it more appealing. I also added transition slides to introduce the next section of my story I was going to discuss. I love using transition slides because it help your user know ahead what is the  next topic you are going to discuss in your presentation / article. 
To emphasize key points and statistics, I strategically highlighted them within the text. Each subsection was prefaced with an introductory sentence to maintain a smooth flow throughout the story. Additionally, I included navigational sections to allow busy readers to easily access specific areas of interest with a simple click.


# Final thoughts
Finding the right data was a challenge for me. Although mental health is recognized as an important issue, there's a scarcity of available data specifically focused on the mental well-being of tech workers. Fortunately, I stumbled upon the Open Source Mental Health survey, which provided a wealth of information. Initially, I intended to explore the mental health of tech workers in the US, but my professors advised that the scope was too broad and suggested focusing on the UK instead. Luckily, I found suitable data in the OSMI survey.
Another struggle I encountered was cleaning the data. Survey data tends to be messy, so I attempted to tidy it up using Tableau, but found it too difficult. I turned to Python for data cleaning, where I removed unnecessary columns and filtered data for UK and US respondents with mental health issues, then saved them as separate Excel datasets.
Most of the data consisted of Yes/No responses, resulting in numerous bar charts, which I wanted to avoid. To address this, I calculated the percentage of Yes and No responses for the relevant fields and created bar and semi-circle pie charts. For a unique perspective on the top mental health issues among tech workers, I opted for a bubble chart in Tableau. However, due to data complexity, I had to utilize Python to clean the data further using regex before creating a separate Excel file for the bubble chart.
Given more time, I would have compared mental health within the tech industry to other sectors, possibly through conducting my own survey. Additionally, I would have explored which positions within the tech industry are most affected by mental health issues and investigated the impact of remote work and layoffs on tech workers' mental health.
Ultimately, despite the initial learning curve, I loved using shorthand and Tableau. As someone interested in data analytics I consider this project invaluable for my career development and look forward to applying the skills learned in future endeavors.

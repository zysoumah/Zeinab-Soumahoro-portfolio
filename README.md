This portfolio will encompass all of my work, including critiques of data visualizations and the data visualizations I create myself.
# About me
I'm Zeinab, currently pursuing a Master's in Data Analytics and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. My pronouns are She/Her. I have a strong passion for collecting data and creating compelling visualizations to tell insightful stories.
# What I hope to learn
In this class, my aspiration is to master the art of crafting compelling data visualizations, employing the perfect blend of colors and design elements. I aim to create visualizations that not only captivate but also ensure instant comprehension for my audience upon their first glance.

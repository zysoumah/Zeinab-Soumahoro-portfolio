# Project Summary
Tech companies are widely recognized for offering high-paying salaries, attracting professionals in pursuit of rewarding careers. However, beneath the surface of this lucrative industry, a growing concern is emerging – the escalating pressure that can significantly impact the mental health of its workforce.
Two years ago, a close friend of mine embarked on an exciting journey by accepting a position in a reputable tech company. Little did she know that this move would be accompanied by an unexpected challenge – a diagnosis of mid-level anxiety. This personal experience triggered a realization about the hidden toll that the fast-paced tech industry can take on the well-being of its employees. The goal of my project is to raise awareness and initiate a conversation about mental health within the tech community, ultimately fostering an environment that prioritizes mental well-being.

# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
>
My target audience consists of individuals already immersed in the tech field or those aspiring to join the industry. I am also focusing on engaging with the human resources departments of tech companies, as they play a vital role in ensuring the well being of their employees. Furthermore, I recognize the importance of involving policy makers in advocating for accessible healthcare, benefiting not only the general population but also addressing the well-being of tech professionals.

##  Selection Process for Interview
The objective of my research is to gather feedback from individuals within my target audience. To achieve this, I conducted interviews with two distinct perspectives. Firstly, I interviewed a friend employed at a tech company to gauge her feelings about my approach to the topics. Given her direct involvement in the subject matter, it is crucial to understand what solutions would be beneficial for her and other tech industry professionals. Additionally, I sought the insights of a friend with a background in public policy to gather thoughts on the feasibility of my proposed call to action from a policy standpoint. Lastly, I interviewed a graduate student from the computer science school to gain a broader perspective on the subject.

##  Interview script
I structured my questions based on their initial impressions of the topic, highlighting any compelling facts that captured their attention and addressing moments of confusion. I also sought feedback on the overall flow and coherence of the narrative, ensuring a smooth transition between different sections. The final set of questions focused on gathering their suggestions and thoughts regarding the intended audience.

# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
>
My target audience consists of individuals already immersed in the tech field or those aspiring to join the industry. I am also focusing on engaging with the human resources departments of tech companies, as they play a vital role in ensuring the well being of their employees. Furthermore, I recognize the importance of involving policy makers in advocating for accessible healthcare, benefiting not only the general population but also addressing the well-being of tech professionals.

##  Selection Process for Interview
The objective of my research is to gather feedback from individuals within my target audience. To achieve this, I conducted interviews with two distinct perspectives. Firstly, I interviewed a friend employed at a tech company to gauge her feelings about my approach to the topics. Given her direct involvement in the subject matter, it is crucial to understand what solutions would be beneficial for her and other tech industry professionals. Additionally, I sought the insights of a friend with a background in public policy to gather thoughts on the feasibility of my proposed call to action from a policy standpoint. Lastly, I interviewed a graduate student from the computer science school to gain a broader perspective on the subject.

##  Interview script
I structured my questions based on their initial impressions of the topic, highlighting any compelling facts that captured their attention and addressing moments of confusion. I also sought feedback on the overall flow and coherence of the narrative, ensuring a smooth transition between different sections. The final set of questions focused on gathering their suggestions and thoughts regarding the intended audience.

## Interview findings 
### 1)  28 years old Male working at the Government of Canada 

#### 1- What are your initial impressions of this project?
 Very engaging, I thoroughly enjoyed going through every detail          
#### 2- What aspects of the information surprised you?                         
 The accessibility of mental health resources at only 10%. I expected a higher percentage given how mainstream the topic is.                         
#### 3- Did you find any parts of the information confusing?                        
Absolutely not, everything is clear!                              
#### 4- Does the sequence of information in the project make sense to you?                        
 Yes, it does!
#### 5- What changes or additions would you suggest?                        
1- One thing I think is missing is the composition of the workforce in these two countries (particularly in the tech industry).More immigrants? The dominant age category? gender? etc. 

2- How does it compare to other industries? The purpose of my question is to understand whether the tech industry is a unique case or whether the trend is general in the US labor market.If you find that the % for other industries is lower, you could mention it so as to strengthen your case. Otherwise, just skip it! It doesn't affect the relevance of your topic

3- You could write a short introductory sentence here too to maintain a coherent structure in your document. You did it for: Similarities in Causes

4- Please remove the decimals on the x-axis.I think you should add the % for the other bars as well.The text is not visible. Maybe black instead of grey?
#### 6- In your opinion, who would you say is the intended audience for this project? 
For tech industry workers, policymakers, and industry leaders. 

### 2) 27 years female working at a 500 fortune Company 
#### 1- What are your initial impressions of this project?
This project is not just about statistics; it's about the well-being of individuals within an industry that drives innovation and progress. It's a reminder that behind every line of code or groundbreaking technology, there are people facing real struggles and challenges. The significance of this project extends beyond the tech industry. It speaks to broader societal issues surrounding mental health awareness, workplace culture, and the importance of prioritizing employee well-being in all sectors. As someone working in the tech industry, this report hits close to home. It's a wakeup call to the industry as a whole to reevaluate its priorities and ensure that the pursuit of excellence doesn't come at the expense of mental health.

#### 2- What aspects of the information surprised you? 
It's surprising to learn that over half of tech professionals in both the UK and the US experience symptoms of depression or anxiety. Also, the high percentage of tech workers in the US who have received a mental health diagnosis is alarming. It underscores the urgent need for more comprehensive support systems and resources within companies to address these issues proactively. These statistics challenge the notion of the tech industry as a glamorous and high-flying sector, instead revealing the toll that its fast-paced and demanding nature can take on individuals' mental well-being.

#### 3- Did you find any parts of the information confusing?  
While the report does a commendable job of explaining complex terms like "Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act," providing real-world examples or case studies could further enhance understanding. This would help readers grasp the practical implications of these policies on the lives of tech workers. Additionally, breaking down technical jargon into simpler language could make the report more accessible to a wider audience. This would ensure that important information about mental health in the tech industry reaches as many people as possible.

#### 4- Does the sequence of information in the project make sense to you? 
The sequence of the report flows logically, guiding readers through the various aspects of mental health challenges in the tech industry in a clear and organized manner. It builds a compelling narrative that highlights the interconnectedness of issues like workplace stress, stigma, and government policies. By presenting data, insights, and recommendations in a structured manner, the report effectively communicates the urgency of addressing mental health issues in the tech sector and provides a roadmap for action.

#### 5- What changes or additions would you suggest?
In addition to including more data and examples, incorporating insights from mental health experts or psychologists could lend credibility to the recommendations put forth in the report. Their perspectives could offer valuable insights into effective strategies for promoting mental well-being in the workplace. Furthermore, exploring the role of technology itself in either exacerbating or alleviating mental health issues could add another layer of depth to the analysis. For example, discussing the impact of social media or digital devices on mental well-being could provide valuable context for understanding the challenges faced by tech workers.

#### 6- In your opinion, who would you say is the intended audience for this project? 
While policymakers, healthcare professionals, and industry leaders are key stakeholders, it's important not to overlook the individual tech workers themselves as part of the intended audience. By empowering employees with knowledge and resources to address their mental health, the report can facilitate positive change from the ground up

### 3)  28 years old female pursuing a Master in Computer Science 
#### 1- What are your initial impressions of this project?
 The project is a "current topic," particularly due to recent layoffs in the tech industry. It sheds light on the experiences of employees within large tech companies, potentially prompting awareness about how employees are treated and the overall work environment.
 
#### 2- What aspects of the information surprised you?                         
 The metrics in the US are higher than the one in UK. It might be due to the fact that Americans are outspoken about their issues
 
#### 3- Did you find any parts of the information confusing?                        
Mental health coverage : the text doesn’t specify what it is, so it’s difficult to perceive the idea and truly measure what it is

#### 4- Does the sequence of information in the project make sense to you?                        
 Yes, it follow a logical structure 
#### 5- What changes or additions would you suggest?                        
Can you be more specific about the call to action? Maybe instead of listing policies, can you also provide existing resources that exist to support tech employees. 
I think that will be more impactful. You could also provie more details about what mental health coverage is 
#### 6- In your opinion, who would you say is the intended audience for this project? 
People willing to work in tech or are looking for a change in career.
